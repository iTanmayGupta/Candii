Candii is a non-profit blockchain based DeFi application that allows users to support their favourite local businesses and content creators who are affected by the pandemic and the rise of ads on social media platforms. Users can browse a list of local businesses and content creators and treat them with Candii where each Candii is $5 worth of Etherium.

Candii uses the MetaMask API to perform all the transactions between users and the client using their respective MetaMask wallet address. We ensure that 100% of the donations go through to the local businesses and content creators. This is made possible by Coil Web Monetization API. With the support of Coil members, we are able to keep our website up and running.

To run the app:
pip install flask
python3 run.py
